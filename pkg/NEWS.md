# betapart 1.5.0

## New features

### New functions to fit, plot and bootstrap distance-decay patterns

`betapart 1.5.0` includes three new functions:
* `decay.model()` fits a negative-exponential or mower law function describing the decay of assemblage similarity with sptatial distance.
* `plot.decay()` allows plotting the curves fitted with `decay.model()`.
* `boot.coefs.decay()` bootstraps the parameters of the functions fitted with `decay.model()`.
